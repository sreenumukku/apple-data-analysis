## Project Overview

This project is designed to showcase advanced SQL querying techniques through the analysis of over 1 million rows of Apple retail sales data. The dataset includes information about products, stores, sales transactions, and warranty claims across various Apple retail locations globally. By tackling a variety of questions, from basic to complex, you'll demonstrate your ability to write sophisticated SQL queries that extract valuable insights from large datasets.

The project is ideal for data analysts looking to enhance their SQL skills by working with a large-scale dataset and solving real-world business questions.

1. **stores**: Contains information about Apple retail stores.
   - `store_id`: Unique identifier for each store.
   - `store_name`: Name of the store.
   - `city`: City where the store is located.
   - `country`: Country of the store.

2. **category**: Holds product category information.
   - `category_id`: Unique identifier for each product category.
   - `category_name`: Name of the category.

3. **products**: Details about Apple products.
   - `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product.
   - `product_name`: Name of the product.
   - `category_id`: References the category table.
   - `launch_date`: Date when the product was launched.
   - `price`: Price of the product.

4. **sales**: Stores sales transactions.
   - `sale_id`: Unique identifier for each sale.
   - `sale_date`: Date of the sale.
   - `store_id`: References the store table.
   - `product_id`: References the product table.
   - `quantity`: Number of units sold.

5. **warranty**: Contains information about warranty claims.
   - `claim_id`: Unique identifier for each warranty claim.
   - `claim_date`: Date the claim was made.
   - `sale_id`: References the sales table.
   - `repair_status`: Status of the warranty claim (e.g., Paid Repaired, Warranty Void).


## Project Focus

This project primarily focuses on developing and showcasing the following SQL skills:

- **Complex Joins and Aggregations**: Demonstrating the ability to perform complex SQL joins and aggregate data meaningfully.
- **Window Functions**: Using advanced window functions for running totals, growth analysis, and time-based queries.
- **Data Segmentation**: Analyzing data across different time frames to gain insights into product performance.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Applying SQL functions to determine relationships between variables, such as product price and warranty claims.
- **Real-World Problem Solving**: Answering business-related questions that reflect real-world scenarios faced by data analysts.


## Dataset

- **Size**: 1 million+ rows of sales data.
- **Period Covered**: The data spans multiple years, allowing for long-term trend analysis.
- **Geographical Coverage**: Sales data from Apple stores across various countries.
